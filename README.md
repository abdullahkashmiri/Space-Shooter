### Space Shooter Game

In my Programming Fundamentals course, I developed a Space Shooter game using graphic libraries and C++ in a 32-bit release. This project involved creating a classic arcade-style game where players control a spaceship to shoot enemies and avoid obstacles.

The development process included designing and implementing key game features such as dynamic graphics, player controls, enemy behavior, and collision detection. I utilized graphic libraries to render visuals and handle animations, ensuring smooth gameplay and an engaging user experience. The gameâ€™s architecture was built around efficient rendering techniques and real-time user input handling.

I focused on applying core programming principles, including object-oriented design, to manage game entities and their interactions. This involved creating classes for the spaceship, enemies, and projectiles, and using methods to handle movement, shooting mechanics, and collision responses. The project also required debugging and optimization to ensure performance was maintained within the constraints of a 32-bit release.

Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to integrate various aspects of programming and game development. It provided practical experience in applying theoretical concepts, problem-solving, and optimizing code for performance. The Space Shooter game reflects my proficiency in C++ and graphic programming, as well as my commitment to creating functional and enjoyable software.
